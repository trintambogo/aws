# Automating Daily reminders with AWS Lambda and Cloudwatch 

Automating reminders can save time and ensure that important tasks are never missed. In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, staying on top of reminders and notifications is crucial. In this article, I will walk you through how I automated a simple meeting reminder to my email using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch.

# Step 1 : Setting up Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)
Before we can send reminders, we need a service that can deliver the message. AWS SNS is a flexible, fully managed messaging service that allows you to send notifications to multiple recipients via SMS, email and even other AWS services.
 ## 1. Creating an SNS Topic
 - In the AWS Management Console, use the search bar to search for SNS (Simple Notification Service)
 - Click on **Create topic**

 - Choose **Standard** as the topic type.
 - Under Name, enter a descriptive name for your topic, such as **Meeting Reminder**.

 - Click Create topic to create the SNS topic
 - Under Subscriptions, click on **Create Subscription**
 - For the protocol, Select **Email**
 - Click **Create subscription**
 - You will receive a confirmation email. Open your email inbox and click on the confirmation link to **confirm your subscription.**
 - You will be required to confirm your subscription through your email address.

 - Once you've confirmed your subscription, go back to the SNS console and refresh your browser.
 - Take note of the **ARN (Amazon Resource Name)** of your SNS topic, which will be needed when configuring your Lambda function

# Step 2 : Setting up AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda allows us to run code without provisioning or managing servers. For this automation, we shall use Lambda to send a daily reminder to our SNS topic.

 ## 1. Creating a function
 -  Click on **create function**
 -  Select **author from scratch**
 -  Enter your desired function name
 -  Under runtime, select **python**
 -  Click on **create function**

- Under the Code section, write the function code.
- The function below takes the ARN for the SNS topic, the message, and the subject for the email, and returns a response indicating whether the message delivery was successful.

- Go to the **IAM role** associated with your **Lambda function.**
- Select the role that AWS creates automatically for the Lambda function

- Click on **Add permissions ** and select Attach policies.
- Search for and attach the **AmazonSNSFullAccess policy** to the role

- Create new test event, deploy the function and test it.
